## Smarter and Safer Transportation in Automobiles
  This is a paper I wrote in the Summer of 2022 for my Technical
  Writing class. I have published it here as I am very interested
  in its subject as well as the analysis madeabout the use of 
  artificial intelligence in new cars. It is a subject that 
  interested me, so for the last two semesters at 
  Mississippi State University I took classes in Artificial
  Intelligence and Artificial Intelligencee in Robotics. 
 
## Decisions Made and the Consequences of Chernobyl
  My technical disaster analysis of the Chernobyl event was also 
  written in the Summer of 2022 for my Technical Writing class. 
  This paper is of a lesser quality when compared to the previous 
  entry as the time I was allowed to refine it was reduced. Still, 
  the technical analysis of the event is brief, humanizing, and easy 
  to understand. 

## Microserviices for an Enhanced User Experience
  My white paper on microservices was written for my Software Architecture
  and Design class in the Fall of 2022. In it I discuss what microservices
  are, their benefits, and how to develop them from the ground up. I feel
  like I could have been somewhat more specific in the discussion of 
  their development, but nevertheless I am proud of this paper.
